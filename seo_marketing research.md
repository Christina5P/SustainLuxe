I used https://www.wordtracker.com/ for SEO

## Meta tags

I used the keywords in:

<title>Sustainluxe | Luxury Second-Hand Fashion, Climate Smart & Sustainable</title>
<meta name="description" content="Discover Sustainluxe â€“ premium second-hand designer fashion with a climate-smart mission. Shop quality, eco-friendly clothes and make a sustainable impact." />
<meta name="keywords" content="second hand, luxury second hand fashion, online second hand stores, eco-friendly fashion, vintage fashion, sustainable fashion, designer second hand, climate smart fashion, used clothes, quality clothes, carbon saving, footprint, circular fashion, save the world, second hand effect, CO2 savings" />

It is also important to use <h1> with high impact keywords, so I added one to Homepage:
<h1 class="text-center">Luxury Second-Hand Fashion for a Sustainable Future at Sustainluxe</h1>

Alt-text to img also affects the SEO

## Sitemap

I use a:
- sitemap.xlm
- roboto.txt

For the competition market I added:
## Facebook page

## Newsletter
