# SustainLuxe - Shop luxurios and Sustainable

## Table of Contents

### [About](#about)

SustainLuxe is a second Hand Shop online for designer clothes.
You find a careful selection of clothes and accessories with quality made only by designers.
Second Hand market grows fast!
The reason for increased shopping in second Hand market is because of financial reason,
but the next as much is environmental reason and it has become a trendy way of shopping.
I will keep it luxury and financial giving, while I will be part of environmental participation.
Through my shop I will be a part of saving the word, through impact people to aknowledge the Second Hand effect 
and donate a part of the revenue to an important organisation to help environmental impact.

I think a lot of people is to busy to take their time for selling unused clothes, so my idea is to make it simple to sell, buy and collect revenues.

You are welcome to visit my store and get to know more!

I have thinking of this idea for some years and in the meantime, the buissness of Second Hand is growing, so I´m happy to present this fictive busisness.
This is a Full-Stack project with Django.
